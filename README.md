# 03-Text-adventure

This is my solution to the 03-Text adventure assignment for MSCH-C220. I have included a couple of .json game description files for anyone to play with.

main_simple.py contains the code we worked out in class (or a close approximation to it). It runs the zork.json file, as long as it is in the same directory.

main.py is a little more complicated. 

This gane is based on how to save the villagers. You have to break through all the previous levels, find the corresponding thing, can be successful clearance. Only after kai is defeated can all the villagers be rescued.  

Features to add at some point
 * Objects in the world
 * inventory management
 * Points (for objects acquired or locations visited)
 * Flags for accomplished events
 * Conditional exits (based on flags)
 * etc.
